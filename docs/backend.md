# SYMPOSIUM Live Backend

This repo now has two runtime surfaces:

- `next dev` / Vercel: the laptop-first SYMPOSIUM interface.
- `npm run api:dev` / Render: the live TypeScript backend.

The existing Next API routes remain in place as a bridge. When `SYMPOSIUM_API_URL` is set on Vercel, those routes proxy to the Render backend. When it is not set, local development keeps using the existing `.data/symposium.json` fallback.

## Local API

```bash
npm run api:dev
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:4000` by default.

Useful endpoints:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`
- `GET /v1/bootstrap`
- `GET /v1/posts`
- `POST /v1/posts`
- `POST /v1/posts/:id/comments`
- `POST /v1/posts/:id/actions`
- `GET /v1/follows`
- `POST /v1/profiles/:handle/follow`
- `DELETE /v1/profiles/:handle/follow`
- `GET /v1/communities`
- `POST /v1/communities/:id/join`
- `GET /v1/communities/:id/calls`
- `POST /v1/communities/:id/calls`
- `POST /v1/calls/:id/join`
- `POST /v1/calls/:id/end`
- `GET /v1/opportunities`
- `POST /v1/opportunities`
- `GET /v1/conversations`
- `POST /v1/messages`
- `GET /v1/notifications`
- `GET /v1/workspace`
- `POST /v1/notes/blocks`
- `POST /v1/notes/publish`
- `POST /v1/assistant/messages`
- `/trpc/*` for the typed procedure router
- Socket.IO on the same server for realtime presence/events

## Environment

Backend:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE=
SYMPOSIUM_STRICT_ENV=true
SYMPOSIUM_WEB_ORIGINS=https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app
SYMPOSIUM_REQUIRE_AUTH=true
SYMPOSIUM_ALLOW_DEV_ACTOR=false
SYMPOSIUM_OWNER_CLERK_USER_ID=user_...
SYMPOSIUM_OWNER_HANDLE=@usharma
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://...
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=...
R2_BUCKET=symposium-uploads
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
SYMPOSIUM_AI_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini
```

Frontend/Vercel:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
SYMPOSIUM_API_URL=https://your-render-api.onrender.com
```

If the Clerk key pair is missing, the frontend deliberately runs in local preview mode. The entrance flow shows a local-preview button, Clerk middleware/provider are skipped, and `/api/auth/sync` returns a controlled 503 instead of crashing. Real account creation/sign-in requires both Clerk keys.

For local bridge testing without production Clerk enforcement on the API, run the backend with:

```bash
SYMPOSIUM_ALLOW_DEV_ACTOR=true
SYMPOSIUM_REQUIRE_AUTH=false
```

That lets local development fall back to `x-symposium-handle` when no Clerk token is available. Production should use Clerk tokens.

When `SYMPOSIUM_API_URL` is configured on Vercel, the Next API bridge treats Render as the source of truth. If Render is unreachable, writes return a controlled 503 instead of silently falling back to local v0 storage.

## Deployment Preflight

Before deploying the Render API, set the provider env vars and run:

```bash
npm run deploy:api:check
```

With `SYMPOSIUM_STRICT_ENV=true`, the API refuses to start unless the live provider boundary is complete:

- Neon/Postgres connection string.
- Clerk backend secret.
- non-local `SYMPOSIUM_WEB_ORIGINS`.
- authenticated writes enabled.
- dev actor fallback disabled.
- Upstash Redis config.
- Cloudflare R2 config.
- owner Clerk user mapping for the reserved `@usharma` handle.

For a smoke test against a running API:

```bash
npm run api:smoke
```

By default this checks `http://localhost:4000`. It verifies liveness, readiness, bootstrap data, communities, community call reads, opportunity reads, and public validation error handling. To check Render:

```bash
SYMPOSIUM_SMOKE_URL=https://your-render-api.onrender.com npm run api:smoke
```

`/healthz` is a cheap process liveness check. `/readyz` is the safer deployment-readiness check: it reports whether the live provider boundary is configured without returning secret values. In strict live mode it expects Neon/Postgres, Clerk, non-local web origins, authenticated writes, disabled dev actors, Upstash, R2, and the reserved owner handle binding. The AI tablet provider is reported separately because the fallback response is valid until model execution policy is finalized.

## Database

Run the migration runner against Neon:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

The migration command fails if no database URL is present, so it is safe to use as the "did I actually point at Neon?" check.

The runner creates the live relational graph:

- users, profiles, preferences
- profile follows
- posts, comments, reactions/saves/forks/reads
- communities, memberships, channels, calls, call participants
- attachments, previews, external links
- DMs, messages, read state
- workspaces, notes, note blocks, note publications
- opportunity/job posts
- AI tablet conversations and messages
- notifications, events, audit logs, moderation reports
- credit accounts, ledger entries, bounties, pledges

On first boot, the backend seeds the current mock SYMPOSIUM world into Postgres so the interface does not become empty.

## Current Boundary

Implemented now:

- Render-ready API service
- Clerk-aware actor layer
- Neon/Postgres schema and migrations
- Upstash-ready rate limiting and event publishing
- R2 signed upload flow
- tRPC-style typed procedure router
- REST compatibility routes for the current Next frontend
- current seed data ported into the live schema
- Clerk provider, sign-in/sign-up modal entry, server-side auth sync, and token forwarding through the Vercel bridge
- no-Clerk local preview mode for laptop UI work without production auth envs
- profile follow/unfollow API
- community join and live call APIs
- opportunity/job post API
- DM/conversation REST API
- workspace block save and note-to-paper publish API
- AI tablet message API with persistent conversation storage and a provider-not-configured fallback

Still intentionally next:

- actual model execution for AI tablet once provider policy/key is set
- full note/workspace UI wiring
- production moderation/admin screens
- payment provider integration after the internal credit ledger is exercised

## First Live Provider Sequence

1. Create the Clerk application and capture `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, and the owner Clerk user id.
2. Create the Neon database and set `DATABASE_URL` or `POSTGRES_URL` locally for the migration pass.
3. Create the Upstash Redis database.
4. Create the Cloudflare R2 bucket and API token.
5. Put the backend env vars in Render and run `npm run deploy:api:check`.
6. Run `npm run db:migrate` against Neon.
7. Deploy the Render API and run `SYMPOSIUM_SMOKE_URL=<render-url> npm run api:smoke`.
8. Open `<render-url>/readyz` and confirm `status: "ready"` with no issues.
9. Put frontend env vars in Vercel: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, and `SYMPOSIUM_API_URL`.
10. Redeploy Vercel and verify sign-in, `/api/auth/sync`, `/api/bootstrap`, post creation, comments, saves, and community browsing against the live API.
